# CoreImageTransitionExplorer
_Simple slide show demonstration using Core Image Transitions and PHImageManager_

## Overview

Here's a demonstration of how Core Images transition filters can be used to create a slide show application. This project offers the user a selection of different transitions selected by a segmented control and it picks images to display randomly from their iOS device's 'moments' album.

You can view [a screen recording of the app in action here](https://youtu.be/SxtIrFJpXUc).
